# Aurora Ventures Website

This is the beginning of the Aurora Ventures website, created by Kr8tiv Multimedia. Aurora Ventures is a portfolio company, and this build captures the first 30 percent of the vision.

The direction is a studio grade, immersive experience with luminous aurora tones, frosted glass panels, editorial typography, and slow cinematic motion. The current version establishes the visual language and layout foundation.

## Roadmap

- Polish the layout, typography, and hierarchy.
- Push the motion system with richer, slower transitions.
- Add a WebGL driven aurora background layer.
- Introduce applications for blockchain analysis and other ecosystem tools.

## Run locally
